# Komsomol

Komsomol is an QT GUI application for calculations of surface acoustic modes in phononic crystal. It determines dispersion relations and profiles of modes by plane wave method (PWM) for a medium consisting of thin layer on a surface of bulk substrate. Thin layer is periodicly altered by cylindrical net of another material. For scientific details see Graczyk P. et al., Simulations of acoustic waves bandgaps in a surface of silicon with a periodic hole structure in a thin nickel film, AIP Advances 4, 077138 (2014).

Komsomol uses GSL and Linpack libraries for complex algebraic calculations. It has a database of predefined materials which can be extended by the user.
